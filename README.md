## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on page layout,page responsiveness and timer functionality.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size

## My process

Change background color of body
Add background images
Add icons and text
Give icon sizes and styles in CSS
Create hover effects for icons
Add React code(useState & useEffect) to create timer

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile first approach
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- React

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained more practise of using React, the main challenge that I overcame was to create React Functionality for the timer.After research and practicing different ways for resolving this step, I wrote the React code which worked eventually.

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic, interactive and functional projects
